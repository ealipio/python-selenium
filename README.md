## Python Selenium

First create the virtual environment

$ python -m venv my-virtual-environment

Go to the new folder created 

$ cd my-virtual-environment

Activate the virtual environment, this also depends of your platform eg for W10

$ .\Scripts\Activate.ps1

Then start coding your tests.

When you finish, deactivate the virtual enviroment just typing 

$ deactivate

That's it. Happy Coding :)
